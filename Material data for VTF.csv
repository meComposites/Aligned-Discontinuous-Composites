TorayCA,T1000GB,PAN-CF,291,5690,5.9,1,5.03,{Naito2007},"Unsure about weibull reference length. Gauge length for experiments is 25mm, but mean strength formula states (?_f ) ?=?_0 L^((-1)/m_f ) ?(1+1/m_f ), so it's thought these values are quoted for a fibre length of 1mm? (actually seems quite common to do this {Paiva2001})"
